# Gold-Rush
The code for a Warcraft 3 map mod project thrown together over a 2-week period for a modding contest.

It is written in [WurstScript](https://github.com/peq/WurstScript). More information about the release of the map can be found on our [HiveWorkshop page](http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/maps-564/gold-rush-v1-1-a-269852/). Here's a [download link](http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/maps.php?p=download&id=v5erlj&toast=e08c899705f58a1138d37bb77fd95f57&dateline=1443702416).

The wurst.dependencies file needs to contain the path to the wurst library files in order for it to be able to compile. Change it to suit your personal machine.
